Entry - 11/3/2016:
  I successfully executed a handshake between the C code on the arduino and the Java code on my computer.  Furthermore, I successfully 
sent/received information from both Java and the arduino.  Also, I used this connection to call two different if statements requiring
input from serial.  Please view VDS3_0/log/ReferenceImages/11.3.2016.png for reference.  Deadline for successful back and forth 
communication between Java program and Teensy 3.6 is 11/7/16.

  Wrote additional serial write statements in order to ensure every message sent from Java is received by the Teensy 3.6.  Kenny Dang
finished the wiring of the BNO055 and BMP180.  Plan for the rest of the day is to confirm a hello world between the Teensy and the two 
sensors.  Deadline for this bench mark is 11/10/16.
