  I successfully executed a handshake between the C code on the arduino and the Java code on my computer.  Furthermore, I successfully 
sent/received information from both Java and the arduino.  Also, I used this connection to call two different if statements requiring
input from serial.  Please view VDS3_0/log/ReferenceImages/11.3.2016.png for reference.  Deadline for successful back and forth 
communication between Java program and Teensy 3.6 is 11/7/16.

  Wrote additional serial write statements in order to ensure every message sent from Java is received by the Teensy 3.6.  Kenny Dang
finished the wiring of the BNO055 and BMP180.  Plan for the rest of the day is to confirm a hello world between the Teensy and the two 
sensors.  Deadline for this bench mark is 11/10/16.

  After some issues with the wiring of the BMP180, I have completed a "helloWorld" run with the pressure and acceleration sensors.  My next
goal is to work on I/O using an SD card and my Java program as an output.  Additionally, my goal is to start developing the main C program
to collect and report flight data.  I have been asked to put my GUI on hold but have began developing a rudimentary prototype at home.  
My next deadline is 11/19/2016 when I have the following items due: help lydia with Kalman filter testing, convert velocity algorithm into
C (complete), download sensor libraries (done), and create a reliable data I/O system using SD card (write function complete).
