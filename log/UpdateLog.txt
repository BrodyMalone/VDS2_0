Entry 1 - 11/3/2016:
  I successfully executed a handshake between the C code on the arduino and the Java code on my computer.  Furthermore, I successfully 
sent/received information from both Java and the arduino.  Also, I used this connection to call two different if statements requiring
input from serial.  Please view VDS3_0/log/ReferenceImages/11.3.2016.png for reference.  Deadline for successful back and forth 
communication between Java program and Teensy 3.6 is 11/7/16.

Entry 1 - 11/5/2016:
  Wrote additional serial write statements in order to ensure every message sent from Java is received by the Teensy 3.6.  Kenny Dang
finished the wiring of the BNO055 and BMP180.  Plan for the rest of the day is to confirm a hello world between the Teensy and the two 
sensors.  Deadline for this bench mark is 11/10/16.

Entry 1 - 11/8/2016:
  After some issues with the wiring of the BMP180, I have completed a "helloWorld" run with the pressure and acceleration sensors.  My 
next goal is to work on I/O using an SD card and my Java program as an output.  Additionally, my goal is to start developing the main C
program to collect and report flight data.  I have been asked to put my GUI on hold but have began developing a rudimentary prototype at 
home.  My next deadline is 11/19/2016 when I have the following items due: help lydia with Kalman filter testing, convert velocity 
algorithm into C (complete), download sensor libraries (done), and create a reliable data I/O system using SD card (write function 
complete).

Entry 1 - 11/9/2016:
  Updated Java Serial Listener to receive strings ending in ';'.  This allows the responses to come across as sentences of any length 
and output all words, characters, and punctuation at the same time.  ';' was chosen as the message tail at random and can easily be 
changed to more rare characters such as '|'.  Also, I have replaced 'A' in the handShake with '~' and also replaced the trash bytes with 
'~' as well to increase reliability of message delivery without limiting the program of likely chars such as 'A'.

Entry 2 - 11/9/2016:
  Finished basic struture of program.  See VDS3_0 in the C code's file.  I still need to write the getAcceleration function using the 
same structure and math from VDS2_0.  Also, I am waiting on Ben Stringer (team lead and co-captian) to develop a request method for our 
BMP180 sensor. Furthermore, I am excited for Denny Joy to finish the List.c (single linked list) program and translate it into a header 
file to greatly increase the effeciency of the program.

Entry 1 - 11/10/2016:
  Ben Stringer added awesome headings to each section of our main program VDS3_0.c.  I began work on a new program called IOTest.c today
to test and stress functions which will retrieve and display data received from different tests and launches and write data to an SD 
card.  Also, I continued to polish and make additions to VDS3_0.c.  I was unable to determine the chipselect pin on the teensy and will 
have to consult with Kenny Dang, an Electrical Engineer, this afternoon before I can continue on IO.

Entry 1 - 11/12/2016:
  Successfully read from and wrote to built in SD card on Teensy 3.6.  This took several days to successfully accomplish as I began by
spending a lot of time attempting the reach the micro SD card through a chip select and MISO/MOSI. I have now found that the best way
to contact the SD card is through a library called SdFat.  Furthermore, it is important to note the SdFat class does not work with the
Teensy 3.6.  The only class I could get to work was SdFatStio.  The next step for me to work on is reading known past flight data from
an SD card in order to simulate the Kalman Filter and other program functions.
